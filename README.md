# Deep-Learning-for-Cryptocurrency-Price-Prediction
This repo makes use of the state-of-art Deep Learning algorithm to predict the price of Bitcoin, which has the potential to generalize to other cryptocurrency. It leverages models such as CNN and RNN implemented by Keras running on top of Tensorflow. You can find more detailed illustration in this blog pos
